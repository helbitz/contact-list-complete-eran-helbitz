# Build a Node.js CRUD App Using React and FeathersJS

Michael Wanyoike walks you through building a full-stack JavaScript CRUD contact list application, using Node, FeathersJS and MongoDB for the back-end API.

This is an updated version of an older project that is now in legacy mode: https://github.com/brandiqa/redux-crud-app.

## Requirements

* [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) (v12+)
* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.org/) (v4.2+)
* [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) package manager


## Installation Steps

1. Clone repo
2. Run `yarn install`
3. Change into the `backend` directory
4. Run `yarn install`
5. Ensure MongoDB is running
6. From the `backend` directory run `yarn start` — this starts the Feathers API server
7. From the project root run `yarn start` — this starts the `create-react-app` server
8. Your default web browser will be launched automatically with the URL [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)
